This has some scad files for generating Janko keyboard keys to replace the normal keys on a MIDI keyboard.

Specifically I've written it specifically for the M-Audio Keystation 49e keyboard.
But the keys of several keyboards, including several other M-Audio keyboards, are very similar.  For many, I would only need to change the part of the key that rests at the back where it hinges.
